# 74 Bootstrap Collapse

An example of using the Accordion functionality of Bootstrap 4
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/collapse/#accordion-example

This example uses 2 fragments.
## Accordion-Container 
Used as a wrapper to add the div with id accordion.
It includes a Drop Zone where we can place a Collection Display fragment, to select the collection of collapsible items we want to show

## Accordion-Element
Used for every element of the collection. It has some mappable fields (texts, image) to map the fields of your Object or Web Content.

This was used to display a list of activites in a Fair. Each activity was a Liferay Object.
But you can use it for whatever you want (F.A.Q, etc..) -> Just add/remove fields in the Accordion-Element, and when you drop this fragment in the collection map the fields of your content accordingly.

### This is how it was used
